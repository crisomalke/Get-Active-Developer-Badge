# Instructions

- Go to https://discord.com/developers/applications, and create a new application on the account you want the badge on
- Go to the bot tab and generate a bot account for the application
- Click the "Reset Token" button to generate a token (if you have 2fa enabled, you'll need your code)
- Copy the token to your clipboard
- Click this badge to clone this repo to a new repl in Replit -> [![Run on Repl.it](https://replit.com/badge/github/crisomalke/get-active-developer-badge)](https://replit.com/new/github/crisomalke/get-active-developer-badge)
  - You will be redirected to Replit, you might have to create an account (you can Register with Google)
- Wait for the repo has finished cloning and the repl to full connect
- Click the green "Run" button at the top
- Go to the console (big black square on the right) and paste in the token you copied earlier (**Note**: ``CTRL + V`` won't work, you'll need to do ``CTRL + Shift + V`` or right-click and click paste
- Press the 'Enter' button
- Wait for it to print 'DONE' in the console, **DON'T STOP THE PROGRAM OR CLOSE THE TAB YET**
- Go back to the application page, go to the "General Information" tab, scroll down and copy application id
- Create a new discord server (you can delete it at the end)
- Enable community on the server
- Use this invite link to add the application to the server: (replace ``{applicationid}`` with what you copied) ``https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id={applicationid}&scope=bot%20applications.commands&permissions=105227086912``
- In the server, go to a channel and use the ``/ping`` command on the bot
- Go to the <https://discord.com/developers/active-developer> page and register everything (**if it says you're not eligible, it's because you're not registered in their system yet. you might have to wait up to 24 hours**)
- Congrats on that shiny new badge
